## Getting Started ‚ú®

### Automated Installation
For installing zap you can use our little [bash script](https://github.com/srevinsaju/zap/blob/main/install.sh).

The installer requires `curl`, `grep` `jq` and `wget` (optional). Please make sure you have it installed.

For system-wide installation (needs `sudo`)
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srevinsaju/zap/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

**Note:** Always Check bash scripts before running as sudo. You can feel free to check out install.sh, it's safe.

For local installation run
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srevinsaju/zap/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Manual Installation

For system-wide installation (needs `sudo`)
```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/srevinsaju/zap/releases/download/continuous/zap-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/zap
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/zap
zap --help
```

For local installation, (requires `~/.local/bin` to be on `$PATH`)
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
wget https://github.com/srevinsaju/zap/releases/download/continuous/zap-amd64 -O ~/.local/bin/zap
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/zap
zap --help
```

> NOTE: Replace `amd64` with your machine architecture. Supported architectures are listed in the [release](https://github.com/srevinsaju/zap/releases/tag/v2-continuous) page 

#### Installing AppImages
All AppImages from the [AppImage Catalog](https://appimage.github.io) and [AppImage catalog v2](https://g.srev.in/get-appimage) can be installed using zap with their registered name.

```bash
zap install element
```
will ask you the version of element you would like to install + download them and do all the hard work of integrating into your system, 
i.e creating desktop files, etc.

You can also install appimages from GitHub releases

```bash
zap install --github --from vscodium/vscodium
```

will put some options which will let you choose the best version for your system.

It is also possible to install AppImage from URLs

```bash
zap install --from https://f.sed.lol/wow.AppImage
```

To integrate a locally downloaded AppImage,
```bash
zap install libresprite ~/Downloads/Libresprite-x86_64.AppImage
```

... or using the `file://` protocol
```bash
zap install --from file:///home/username/Downloads/My_Super_Cool-x86_64.AppImage name_of_the_app_here
```
here, `name_of_the_app_here` specifies the name of the application. This name will be used 
as a unique identification of the AppImage, by zap, in its internal database.

 
#### Updating AppImages üîÑ
AppImages can be optionally, [automatically updated using the `zapd`](#Daemon), but to achieve this manually, you need to 
```bash
zap update firefox
```
This will make use of the update information embedded within the appimage, which if exists, will be used to 'delta-update' the latest
version, by downloading "only" the parts which have changed.

For those AppImages not supporting delta updates, you can still do 
```bash
zap install zoom
```
to install the latest version of Zoom.


##### Upgrade üöÄ
`zap` also supports updating all the apps together using `appimage-update`. 

```bash
zap upgrade
```


#### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
It is possible to interactively configure `zap`. All you need to do is 
```bash
zap init
```
And answer all the questions that would follow.


#### Daemon üèÉ

`zapd` is a Zap AppImage daemon which periodically checks for updates.

```bash
zap daemon --install
```

This will install a `systemd` service in the local (user) level, which will spawn `zap daemon` which auto-updates 
the AppImages. 

To run the daemon (sync), do 
```bash
zap daemon
```
